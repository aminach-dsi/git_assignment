b. What is a pull request?
    - A pull request is a request to merge code changes from one branch to another, enabling review, discussion, and integration of those changes into the main codebase.
c. Steps to Open a Pull Request:
    - Create a Branch: Start by creating a new branch for your changes.
    - Make Changes: Commit your changes to this branch.
    - Push to GitHub: Push the branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
    - Open Pull Request: Navigate to your repository on GitHub, select your branch, and click the "Compare & pull request" button.
    - Review & Submit: Review the changes, add a title and description, then click "Create pull request."

    - Go to Repository Settings: Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the "Settings" tab.

e. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    - Git is a version control system used to track changes in code locally.
    - GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories, enabling collaboration and sharing of code.
f. What does git diff do?
    - git diff shows the differences between files or commits, highlighting changes that have not yet been staged or committed.
g. What is the main branch?
    - The main branch is the default and primary branch in a Git repository where the stable, production-ready code is typically stored.
